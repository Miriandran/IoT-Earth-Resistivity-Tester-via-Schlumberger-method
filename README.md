## 📊 Scientific Calculation
Resistivity ($\rho_A$) is calculated using the Schlumberger formula:

$$p_{A}=\frac{V}{I}\pi\frac{b(b+a)}{a}$$

Where:
* $V$ = Measured potential difference.
* $I$ = Injected current.
* $b$ = Distance from current electrode to potential electrode.
* $a$ = Distance between potential electrodes.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Set Up Electrodes**: Position the four electrodes in the soil according to the Schlumberger configuration.
2. **Input Distances**: Use the keypad to enter the distances between electrodes (MN and AM).
3. **Start Measurement**: Press the '#' key to trigger the measurement cycle.
4. **Read Data**: The device will inject current, read sensors, and display the calculated **Ohm-m** value on the LCD.
